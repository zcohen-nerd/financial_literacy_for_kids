# Financial Literacy Curriculum - Docusaurus Website

This website contains a comprehensive 18-week Financial Literacy Curriculum designed for kids. It's built with [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 18.0 or above)
- npm (comes with Node.js)

### Local Development

1. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   cd website
   npm install
   ```

2. **Start Development Server**
   ```bash
   npm run start
   ```

   This command starts a local development server and opens your browser to `http://localhost:3000`. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

3. **Build for Production**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

   This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.

## Curriculum Content

The curriculum is organized into weekly lessons in the `docs/` directory of this Docusaurus site.

- **Weeks 1–4**: Value Foundations — Trade, currency, needs vs. wants, household budgets
- **Weeks 5–8**: The Flow of Resources — How money moves, digital payments, and spending behavior
- **Weeks 9–11**: Strategy & Planning — Budgeting, opportunity costs, emergency funds
- **Weeks 12–14**: Economic Systems — Banks, interest, and inflation
- **Weeks 15–18**: The Value Creation Project — Entrepreneurship capstone

The lesson sequence is designed to move students toward stronger thinking skills over time, with frequent prompts to analyze choices, evaluate results, and create improved work.

## Configuration

### Site Configuration

The main site configuration is in `docusaurus.config.js`. Key settings include:

- **Site Info**: Title, tagline, favicon
- **Deployment**: GitHub Pages configuration
- **Navigation**: Navbar and footer links
- **Theme**: Colors and styling options

### Sidebar Configuration

The documentation sidebar is generated from the files in `website/docs`. Configuration is in `sidebars.js`.

## Deployment

### Automatic Deployment (Recommended)

This site is configured for automatic deployment to GitHub Pages using GitHub Actions:

1. **Push to Main Branch**: Any push to the `main` branch triggers the deployment workflow
2. **GitHub Actions**: The workflow builds the site and deploys it to the `gh-pages` branch
3. **GitHub Pages**: Serves the site from the `gh-pages` branch

### Manual Deployment

If you prefer manual deployment:

```bash
# Build the site
npm run build

# Deploy to GitHub Pages (requires proper git configuration)
npm run deploy
```

### GitHub Pages Setup

To enable GitHub Pages for your repository:

1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Navigate to Settings > Pages
3. Set Source to "Deploy from a branch"
4. Select the `gh-pages` branch
5. Your site will be available at: `https://[username].github.io/[repository-name]/`
